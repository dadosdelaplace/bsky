## Draft 69

:::: columns
::: {.column width="37%"}

🗺 In 1955, the U.S. embarked on the [**Vietnam War**]{.hl-green}, a war that would last for more than 20 years. As recruitment increased, protests began: they were not only against the war itself but also against the [**Draft, an opaque, biased, and racist selection process**]{.hl-green}.

[**Fact**]{.hl-yellow}: until 1967, more than 60% of those drafted were Black people, despite making up only 30% of the population to be recruited.

## Draft 69

:::: columns
::: {.column width="64%"}

🗳 To quell criticism of the biased process (as 40 000 recruits were needed each month), President Johnson decided to implement a [**lottery-based draft (the first since World War II): the 1969 Vietnam "Draft Lottery"**]{.hl-green}

🙋 Candidates: men born between 1944 and 1950

🔢 Structure: 366 slots (gaps on a list) to be filled

📆 Process: 366 strips of paper, each representing a day of the year, were written and mixed

🔀 Selection: dates were drawn one by one and assigned to the slots

&nbsp;

🕵 Was it truly fair?️

🪖 Men born between 1944 and 1950 on the days corresponding to the [**first 195 dates drawn would be drafted**]{.hl-green} for the war.

🕵 Is there the [**same % of ballots below 195 in each month**]{.hl-yellow}?
